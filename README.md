Older adults with Type 2 Diabetes face unique challenges: difficulty using apps due to vision or dexterity issues, isolation, and lack of ongoing, tailored support. Most diabetes solutions are reactive and static. DiaVoice introduces a proactive, agentic AI—a voice-first companion that not only responds but initiates meaningful, context-aware interactions to actively support and guide daily diabetes care while fostering emotional well-being.

Meet **DiaVoice** — a new **voice enabled medical assistant** designed specifically for people living with diabetes and face other challenges like old age, vision or dexterity issues. Powered by cutting-edge AI technologies, DiaVoice combines **voice input and output** with a **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) backend**, creating an intuitive, conversational experience that feels almost like speaking to a human expert and support.

## Why We Created DiaVoice – A Voice-First Companion for Older Adults with Diabetes
we created DiaVoice because we saw a fundamental mismatch between the tools available for diabetes management and the real-world needs of the people who rely on them—especially older adults living with Diabetes. Most solutions today assume a level of tech-savviness, manual input, and visual interaction that many seniors simply find challenging. Vision decline, reduced dexterity, and cognitive fatigue turn seemingly simple apps into daily obstacles. What’s more, these tools tend to be reactive and impersonal, offering generic reminders rather than meaningful, adaptive support.
But diabetes isn’t just about logging numbers—it’s a daily emotional and behavioral journey. Many seniors live alone, lack consistent human support, and face decision fatigue around medication, meals, and how they feel each day.
- We wanted to remove the friction of managing diabetes by introducing an always-there, voice-first AI that speaks their language—literally and hence DiaVoice was born.
- We focused on agentic design, so the AI initiates care—not just waits for input. It checks in, notices patterns, nudges gently, and knows when to involve caregivers.
- We designed DiaVoice to be emotionally intelligent—not just a tracker, but a trusted companion who listens, learns, and evolves with the user.
In short, we built DiaVoice to bring care to the user, rather than forcing the user to chase care through yet another screen. Because at this stage of life, what users need most is support that’s personal, proactive, and human-like. That’s exactly what DiaVoice delivers.

## Key Features

### 1. Voice Interaction
With voice input and output capabilities, DiaVoice Buddy allows users to **talk naturally** to the chatbot — no typing necessary. Whether you're cooking, exercising, or simply prefer speaking, you can:
- **Ask questions aloud**
- **Hear answers read back clearly**
- **Have a multi-turn conversation** to dive deeper into topics (is this available) ??

The experience is designed to be hands-free, making it especially helpful for users with limited mobility, vision challenges, or those multitasking.

### 2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Engine
Unlike basic chatbots that rely only on pre-programmed scripts, Diabe-AI Buddy uses a **RAG-based architecture**. Here's how it works:
- It **retrieves** relevant, up-to-date information from a trusted diabetes-focused knowledge base.
- It **generates** coherent and customized answers, integrating retrieved facts into natural, human-like responses.
- It **Suggests** addition questions that they user may be looking answers for as follow up questions

This ensures that the chatbot is both **grounded in factual knowledge** and **adaptive to your unique questions**, even if they are highly specific.

### 3. Trusted Medical Content
The knowledge base used by Diabetes Buddy is curated from credible sources, including:
- American Diabetes Association guidelines
- Peer-reviewed clinical articles
- Nutrition and exercise recommendations for diabetics
- FAQs from certified diabetes educators

While Diabe-AI Buddy is **not a substitute for professional medical advice**, it is carefully designed to **supplement your learning ** and **provide support and companionship**.
